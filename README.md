## Overview of the Analysis
In this analysis we looked into data about a bikesharing program in New York City. The primary focus of this analysis is the gender of riders, and the timing and duration of rides. We created a Tableau story in order to illustrate our findings.

## Results
Now we shall discuss the visualized findings one by one.

1. The gender pie chart is the first and simplest visualization to explore. It demonstrates that ridership for the bikeshare program is overwhelmingly male. The red colored slice of the pie is 'unkown' gender and, even if it were entirely female, the majority of ridership would remain male. 1-Gender_pie.PNG

2. The 'Trip Duration by minute and hour' visualization gives trip duration in hours and minutes. Along the X axis on the bottom of the graph you can see the time increments in minutes and along the top you'll notice that each of the three lanes represents the hour within which those minutes are being counted. We can see that there are very few riders using bikes for more than 40 minutes (about 10k) and the majority of riders are using the bikes for 5 to 10 minutes at a time. 2-ridership_times.PNG

3. The 'Trip Duration by Gender' visualization gives the same information as the prior visualization, only now it is broken down by gender. We can note that men and women follow a similar pattern of trip duration with most riding between 5-10 minutes at a time. However we should note that those individuals of 'Unkown' gender have a have a flatter curve than the rest and the duration of their rides is fairly even between 10-30 minutes. 3-gender_ride_times.PNG

4. The 'Start Time by Day of Week' visualization is a heatmap representing the most frequent ride start times as the densest colors of the heatmap. You will note that during the week, riders appear to be using the bikeshare program to commute to and from work, as the most frequent ride start times correspond with the beginning and end of the workday. 4-start_time_day_of_week

5. The 'Start time by Gender' visualization is a heatmap showing balls of light with different color saturations depending on the concentration of riders at a given hour of the day. The 'hotter' looking balls represent a higher concentration. This display allows you to clearly see the times of day at which the 3 gender types begin their rides. 5-Start_time_by_gender

6. The 'User Type Count by Day of Week' visualization looks more specifically on the basis upon which people use the bikes. Customers purchase rides one at a time whereas subscribers purchase multiple rides over a period of time at once. We can see from this visualition that the majority of users of the bikeshare program are subscribers, and that Thursday and Friday are the most popular days to begin a ride. 6-User_type_count_by_day_of_week.png

7. The final visualization is the 'Age of Rider' visualization. On the X-axis we can see the birthdates of riders. Here we note that, in a bizarre finding, 1969 is the birth-year for the vast majority of riders. Who knew?! 

## Summary

To summarize. The vast majority of riders are men. Both men and women tend to use the bikesharing program in a similar way. People born in 1969 disproportionately use the bikesharing service compared with any other birth year. 

Further visualizations that may be helpful are a heatmap of rider gender by age, and a geographical heatmap showing where male and female riders most often begin rides.
